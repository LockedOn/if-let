# if-let and Friends

Are a set of macros to allow more than one binding for `if-let`, `when-let`, `if-some` and `when-some`.

These macros are convientenly named `if-let*`, `when-let*`, `if-some*` and `when-some*`. The true branch of these macros are evaluated when all bindings pass the `if`/`some` condition.

## Usage

Install in project.clj
![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lockedon/if-let/latest-version.svg)

Usage is similar to their `clojure.core` counterpart.

Require: `[if-let.core :refer :all]` in your namespace.

```clojure
(ns user
    (:require [if-let.core :refer :all]))

(if-let* [a 1
          b 2]
    (+ a b)
    "false branch")
;; => 3

(if-let* [a 1
          b nil]
    (+ a b)
    "false branch")
;; => "false branch"
```
